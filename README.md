# Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset is taken from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.
# About
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, management of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly hypertension and dyslipidemia, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
The objective of the project is to forecast the 10-year probability of future coronary heart disease (CHD) among patients residing in Framingham, Massachusetts. To achieve this, a dataset encompassing details about the patients' demographics, behaviors, and medical vulnerabilities has been employed as the foundation for constructing a predicting model. This model will harness the capabilities of machine learning methodologies to scrutinize the available data comprehensively, thereby facilitating precise prognostications of CHD risk.
